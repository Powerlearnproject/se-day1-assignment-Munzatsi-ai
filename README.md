# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is a sytematic  application of engineering principles and tools to the development and maintaince of quality softwares.
It enables creation of software application and systems that support various aspects of modern life .


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
milestones include development of programming languages,the establishment of software engineering as adiscipline 
the advent of structured programming and rise of agile  methodologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design:creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation:writing code and building the software that meets quality standards 
Testing:Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment:Realsing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance:Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards eg requirements,design,implementation while Agile iterative and incremental approach
focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer:Ensure  software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning execution and delivery of software systems.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs help in providing comprehensive tools for writing ,debuging and testing code eg visiual studio
VCS is software tools for tracking changes to source code  and coordinating work among team members eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines , provide a excact and realistic time to complete the project.
change of Requirements,give time for change and inform about delays that may occur.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing involves testing individual components of a software
intergration testing involves testing interactions between different components
acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
importance of of  this is to ensure such code reviews,automated testing and continous intergration help identify and fix defects early in the development process


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get best possible responses from AI models
Its important to help avoid that by making your questions clear and specific


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
its used in real world application like chatbots, virtual assistants and content generation tools eg creating images
